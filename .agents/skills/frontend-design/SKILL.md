# Frontend Design

Generates distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic AI aesthetics.

## What It Does

Nano Code automatically uses this skill for frontend work. Creates production-ready code with:

- Bold aesthetic choices
- Distinctive typography and color palettes
- High-impact animations and visual details
- Context-aware implementation

## Usage Examples

```
"Create a dashboard for a music streaming app"
"Build a landing page for an AI security startup"
"Design a settings panel with dark mode"
```

The assistant will choose a clear aesthetic direction and implement production code with meticulous attention to detail.

## Key Principles

### 1. Avoid Generic AI Aesthetics

**DON'T produce:**

- Specific font pairings with intention
- Custom color schemes with personality
- Purposeful whitespace and layout
- Unique interaction patterns

### 2. Make Bold Choices

- Choose a clear design direction
- Commit to an aesthetic vision
- Use distinctive typography
- Create memorable visual details

### 3. Production-Ready Quality

- Responsive by default
- Accessible (WCAG compliant)
- Performance optimized
- Cross-browser compatible
